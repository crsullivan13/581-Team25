# regressions.py by Junyi Zhao
# regressions.py should be including all methods to deal with regression calls when finished. 
# log: created Sep 25 - includes a basic linear regression method for the group to discuss with inputs and outputs, others still under construction - Junyi
# log: modified Oct 12 - added a demo function to play with test and train size and random state for MNIST classifier - Junyi
# log: modified Oct 18 - Modified Linear Regression to take in params and return model and added both Logistics and Decision Tree Regression - Amith Panuganti
# log: modified Oct 21 - Add more Hyperparameters for Logistics and Decession Tree Regression - Amith Panuganti
# log: Added kwarg integration to simplify programming
