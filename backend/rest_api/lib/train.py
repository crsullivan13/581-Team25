        Revision: Create train model function which will
        train a model give features and labels
        Author: Amith Panuganti
    10/7/22
        Revision: Re-edit params since for all possible models
        from sklearn, we will only get weight and biases
        Author: Amith Panuganti
    10/10/22
        Revision: Convert features and labels into numpy arrays so that the regressions
        model will run properly
        Author: Amith Panuganti
    11/1/22
        Revision: Added descriptive error messages, kwarg integration
    11/6/22
        Revision: Add support for getting metrics, specifically figures for training
        Author: Amith Panuganti 
    11/15/22
        Revision: Add Supported for MLP, Naive Bayes, and Decesion Tree Algorithms
        Author: Derrick Quinn
    11/20/22
        Revision: Added support for input validation
        Author: Derrick Quinn
