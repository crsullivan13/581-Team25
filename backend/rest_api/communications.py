# communications.py by Junyi Zhao
# communications.py should be including all methods to talk with front end when finished. 
# log: created Sep 25 - includes a basic json output method for the group to discuss with json files, read method still under construction
# log: modified Oct 23 - added prototype of reading arguments by command line. Rest of the function still TBD - Junyi Zhao

def ReadArguments(): # read system arguments to run proper commands
