    1. Review what the user should already know, linear regressions
    Show how linear regressions is not good for classification
    Provide example of not being applicable
    2. Interactive Part #1: Let user create linear regressions model with example
    Return the loss the show case just how bad the model is 
    3. Explain through example why linear regressions is a bad idea.
    Suggest alternative by properly introudcing losgistic regression.
    Explain what it is used for, and how it works
    4. Interactive Part #2: Let user create logsitic regression model with example
    Return the loss and graph to show how good the model is

            <p>
              Linear Regression is good for a type of machine learning called regression, which aims to predict a value of a variable based on the values of other variables.
              However, what linear regression is not good for is classification, which aims to determine the class of an object based the values of its variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, lets say that I have a heater at home that controls the temperature of the house. 
                I want to know what temperatures make the house feel cold or hot so that I can control whether
                I want be cold or hot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For this example, we are going to use the following dataset
            </p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Temperature</th>
                    <th>Cold or Hot</th>
                </tr>
                {dataset.map ((val, key) => {
                    return (
                        <tr key = {key}>
                            <td>
                                {val.temperature}
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                {val.feel}
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    )
                })}
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                However, we need to convert both hot and cold into classes for classification.
                Each class is assigned an integer value starting for 0. In this case, we set the cold class to be 0
                and hot class to be 1. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After assigning each cold and hot value a class, we having the following dataset:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Temperature</th>
                    <th>Class</th>
                </tr>
                {dataset.map ((val, key) => {
                    return (
                        <tr key = {key}>
                            <td>
                                {val.temperature}
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                {val.class}
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    )
                })}
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        </>
    )
}

//Create Part 1 After Training
function LogisticRegressionPart1After(props)
{
    return(
        <div>
        <p>From the graph, you can see that the linear regression is not a good fit for the data. 
            While the line cross a few points, it cannot go through all the points on the graph
            This is because there are multiple points on the graph that contain the same graph. 
            This contradicts with the main assumption of regression, in which differnt inputs will
            lead to different outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, linear regression is not a good idea for classification. Then, what other model
            can we use for classification? This is where logistic regresion comes in.
